Getting Started
---------------
This application statically stores a list of Movie() objects, and using attributes like youtube_trailer, and poster_art, generate a static web page to display them.  It relies on a fork of Udacity's 'fresh_tomatoes.py' module.  The orginal source of this can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode)
